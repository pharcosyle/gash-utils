Usage: rmdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.

Options:
      --help              display this help and exit
  -p, --parents           remove DIRECTORY and its ancestors; e.g., 'rmdir -p a/b/c' is
                          similar to 'rmdir a/b/c a/b a'
      --version           output version information and exit
