;;; Commentary:

;;; This is a fallback module for the bootstrap guile where (ice-9
;;; readline) is not available.

;;; Code:

(define-module (gash readline)
  #:use-module (ice-9 rdelim)
  #:export (add-history
            clear-history
            read-history
            readline
            with-readline-completion-function
            write-history))

(define (add-history x) #t)
(define (clear-history) #t)
(define (read-history x) #t)
(define (readline prompt) (display prompt) (read-line))
(define (with-readline-completion-function completion thunk) (thunk))
(define (write-history x) #t)
