Gash-Utils
**********

Gash-Utils provides Scheme implementations of many common POSIX
utilities (there are about 40 of them, ranging in complexity from
'false' to 'awk').  The utilities are designed to be capable of
bootstrapping their standard GNU counterparts.  Underpinning these
utilities are many Scheme interfaces for manipulating files and text.
One of the goals of this project is to expose these interfaces and
provide Guile users with all the superpowers available to a standard
POSIX shell (but with way more parens, obviously).  While the
utilities are able (with some difficulty) to do the bootstrapping job,
the Scheme interfaces are still under development and are not ready
for public use.

Requirements
============

Gash-Utils depends on Gash <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gash/>.

Installing
==========

This package uses GNU Autotools for building and installing.  For
details on how to configure, build, and install it, see the file named
'INSTALLING'.

If you have GNU Guix, you can skip all that and install the package
by running:

     guix package -f guix.scm

Gash-Utils is designed to work with Guile versions as early as 2.0.9.

Testing
=======

Gash-Utils includes a number of unit and integration tests that can be
run using 'make check'.  If you are using Guile 2.0.9, you will have to
make SRFI 64 available to run the unit tests.  To do this, you can copy
'module/srfi/srfi-64.scm' and the 'module/srfi/srfi-64' directory from a
newer version of Guile into a directory named 'srfi' in the Gash-Utils
source code directory.
