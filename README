ANGUISH: that which you might experience when your shell
falls short of expressing your programming solution

or

AN[other] GUIle SHell
Anguish is Not a GUIle SHell

This project aims to produce at least a POSIX compliant sh replacement
or even implement GNU bash.  On top of that it also intends to make
scheme available for interactive and scripting application.  The
approach also intends to allow capturing the intermediate scheme
representation of the "original" shell script to offer a migration
path away from [ba]sh. On top of this GNU make could similarly be
replaced, as make turns out to be fraught with limitations and
complexities.  One of the features I personally desire is not be
forced to keep doing what was done in the past, i.e. once an object
file is produced, it does not have to be produced again as long as the
original is kept around. The orignal must be replaced when any of its
dependencies change (source, compiler options, linker, etc.)

I feel that the shell has been instrumental on my path to embracing
functional programming, however now I mostly experience that the
language itselfs folds on functional expression, pun intended.




* history flattened vs full, i.e. navigate interactively without
  redundancy vs export as script
