Noteworthy changes in release 0.2.0 (2022-03-12)
================================================

New features

  - awk has been mostly rewritten, and now supports most of the
    standard POSIX features.
  - The env utility.
  - sort understands the 'check', 'dictionary-order', 'ignore-case',
    'ignore-nonprinting', 'ignore-blanks', 'field-separator', and 'key'
    options.
  - sed supports the 'c', 'P', and 'D' functions.
  - printf actually formats strings, and supports the 's', 'c', 'd',
    'u', 'x', 'X', and '%' format specifiers.  It also supports flags,
    width, and precision for numeric format specifiers.
  - tar can read some GNU extensions (long name and long link).
  - sed understands the 'separate' option, and turns it off by default.
    This is instead of the old behavior, which was to always treat files
    separately.
  - cp supports the 'preserve' option.
  - tar guesses the compressor from the file name when creating
    archives.
  - sed ignores comments.
  - tar will accept but ignore the 'files-from' and 'auto-compress'
    options for compatibility's sake.
  - rm prints a warning if no files are specified (unless the 'force'
    flag is in effect).
  - rm accepts the 'help' and 'version' options.

Bug fixes

  - The 'n' sed function now respects the 'quiet' option.
  - The 'n' sed function now works on the final input line.
  - sed no longer fails to parse regexes with collating symbols,
    equivalence classes, and character classes.
  - Range addresses in sed can now match more than once.
  - rm now continues to process files after an error.
  - rmdir no longer prints debugging output.
  - mkdir no longer inverts the file mode value.
  - tar can now unpack non-ASCII files.
  - The main sed loop is now tail-recursive on the bootstrap Guile
    (2.0.9), allowing it to handle larger files.
  - mv now considers an empty file list an error.
  - ls now knows the difference between dotfiles and relative paths
    beginning with dots (e.g., "./foo").
  - sed address delimiters can now be escaped if needed.
  - uname now understands no flags to mean 'kernel-flags'.
  - tar now allows 'f' anywhere in a command string instead of only at
    the end.
  - sed will no longer continue to process files after executing the 'q'
    function.  It used to quit processing only the current file.
